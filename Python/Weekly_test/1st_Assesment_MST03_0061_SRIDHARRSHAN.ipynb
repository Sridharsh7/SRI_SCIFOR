        "Encapsulation is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the methods and data. Encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers to control access to the class's data and methods.\n",
